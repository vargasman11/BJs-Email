## installation
Please run ```npm install``` to spin up the project. The ``` index.html``` file is the finaled file to be rendered locally.
To convert and watch the input mjml file, run ```npm run mjml``` in your terminal.

## Assets
All assets have a relative local path to the ```index.html``` file.
I've included a CDN link to the ```Roboto``` font family as it is a Free font. Helvetica Neue and Arial are "proprietary" fonts of "Monotype Imaging" and sometimes require licensing. These fonts are typically accessible in windows machines and MacOS.

## Tooling
I used [MJML](https://mjml.io/) to write semantic syntax to compile fallbacks for major email clients. The file where MJML is written is located in the ```input.mjml``` file.
